Cool thing about this team is that I brought all the mons about evenly and just played each matchup separately. There isn't anything super exciting when it comes to this team, but the Hands spread and Arcanine spread both performed quite well. There were also a large number of games where I didn't Tera at all, since the threat of holding defensive Teras was actually more important than Tera'ing in a lot of situations. Since all my mons had defensive Teras, I could try to force weird interactions even into the later turns of the game by holding the Tera for longer.
